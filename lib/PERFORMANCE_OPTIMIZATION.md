# Sudoku App Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Sudoku app to ensure smooth, responsive gameplay.

## Key Performance Improvements

### 1. State Management Optimization
- **Batched setState calls**: Multiple state updates are batched into single setState calls
- **Debounced operations**: Storage operations are debounced to avoid excessive I/O
- **Update guards**: Prevents unnecessary updates during state transitions

### 2. Widget Rendering Optimization
- **RepaintBoundary**: Isolates repainting areas to minimize unnecessary redraws
- **const constructors**: Uses const constructors where possible to prevent widget recreation
- **ValueKey**: Provides stable keys for list items to optimize Flutter's diffing algorithm
- **Optimized cell rendering**: Individual cells are optimized with minimal rebuilds

### 3. Algorithm Optimization
- **Caching**: Expensive calculations (placement checks, conflict detection) are cached
- **Background processing**: Heavy computations run on background threads using `compute()`
- **Efficient data structures**: Uses Sets for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) searches

### 4. Memory Management
- **Limited undo/redo stack**: Prevents memory leaks from unlimited undo history
- **Proper disposal**: Resources are properly disposed to prevent memory leaks
- **Cache invalidation**: Caches are cleared when grid state changes

## Performance Best Practices

### 1. Minimize setState Calls
```dart
// ❌ Bad: Multiple setState calls
setState(() => selectedRow = row);
setState(() => selectedCol = col);
setState(() => selectedCells.clear());

// ✅ Good: Batched setState
_batchUpdate(() {
  selectedRow = row;
  selectedCol = col;
  selectedCells.clear();
});
```

### 2. Use RepaintBoundary Strategically
```dart
// ✅ Good: Isolate repainting areas
RepaintBoundary(
  child: SudokuGrid(...),
)
```

### 3. Optimize List Generation
```dart
// ❌ Bad: Rebuilding entire list on every frame
List.generate(9, (i) => List.generate(9, (j) => SudokuCell()))

// ✅ Good: Use const constructors and stable keys
List.generate(9, (i) => List.generate(9, (j) => 
  _SudokuCell(key: ValueKey('cell-$i-$j'), ...)
))
```

### 4. Cache Expensive Calculations
```dart
// ✅ Good: Cache placement checks
static bool canPlaceNumber(...) {
  final cacheKey = '${row}_${col}_$number';
  if (_placementCache.containsKey(cacheKey)) {
    return _placementCache[cacheKey]!;
  }
  // ... calculation and cache result
}
```

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Debug Mode Features
- Performance overlay shows frame rate and rendering statistics
- Performance metrics are logged every 5 seconds in debug mode
- Visual indicators for performance mode

### 2. Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Frame rate**: Should maintain 60fps during gameplay
- **Memory usage**: Should remain stable during extended play
- **CPU usage**: Should be minimal during idle periods

## Common Performance Issues & Solutions

### 1. Janky Scrolling
**Problem**: Grid scrolling feels choppy
**Solution**: Use RepaintBoundary and optimize cell rendering

### 2. Slow Input Response
**Problem**: Number input feels delayed
**Solution**: Debounce storage operations, batch state updates

### 3. High Memory Usage
**Problem**: App consumes too much memory
**Solution**: Limit undo stack, clear caches, proper disposal

### 4. Battery Drain
**Problem**: App drains battery quickly
**Solution**: Minimize unnecessary rebuilds, use efficient algorithms

## Testing Performance

### 1. Performance Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on low-end devices
- [ ] Monitor frame rate during gameplay
- [ ] Check memory usage over time
- [ ] Test with large undo/redo operations
- [ ] Verify smooth scrolling and input

### 2. Performance Profiling
```bash
# Enable performance profiling
flutter run --profile

# Monitor performance metrics
flutter run --trace-startup
```

## Future Optimizations

### 1. Planned Improvements
- Virtual scrolling for large puzzle lists
- Lazy loading for variant constraints
- More efficient custom painters
- Advanced caching strategies

### 2. Architecture Considerations
- Consider Riverpod for state management
- Implement proper command pattern for undo/redo
- Add dependency injection for better testability

## Maintenance

### 1. Regular Performance Reviews
- Monitor performance metrics weekly
- Review code for new performance issues
- Update optimization strategies as needed

### 2. Performance Regression Testing
- Automated performance tests
- Baseline performance metrics
- Performance budget enforcement

## Conclusion
Following these optimization guidelines will ensure your Sudoku app maintains smooth, responsive performance across all devices. Regular monitoring and testing are essential to maintain optimal performance as the app evolves.
